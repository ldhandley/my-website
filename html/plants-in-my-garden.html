            <h1>Lilac</h1>
            <p>
              The lilac is a beloved shrub known for its fragrant spring blooms
              and classic cottage garden charm. Though not native to the Pacific
              Northwest, it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, rewarding
              gardeners each year with clusters of purple, pink, or white
              flowers that attract pollinators and nostalgic gardeners alike. A
              mature lilac can become a centerpiece in your garden, providing
              both beauty and scent as it bursts into bloom each spring.

            <h1>Menzie's Larkspur</h1>
            <p>
              Menzies’ Larkspur is a striking native wildflower found in
              prairies and open woods throughout the Puget Sound region. With
              its vibrant blue-violet spurred flowers and deeply lobed leaves,
              this plant adds a burst of color to early spring gardens. It
              prefers well-drained soils and sunny to lightly shaded spots, and
              it’s a favorite of native bumblebees and butterflies. This species
              is a great way to bring more biodiversity into your landscape
              while honoring the beauty of local ecosystems.

            <h1>Hydrangea</h1>
            <p>
              Hydrangeas are a classic garden staple known for their lush,
              globe-like flower heads and ability to shift color depending on
              soil pH. While not native to the Pacific Northwest, they grow
              wonderfully in the region’s mild, moist climate and make a lovely
              addition to shaded garden areas. With varieties ranging from bold
              blues to delicate pinks and creamy whites, hydrangeas offer
              long-lasting blooms from late spring through summer and provide
              structural interest even in the dormant months.
