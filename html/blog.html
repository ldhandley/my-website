                <h2>ðŸŒ¿ Thriving with Less: Drought-Tolerant Native Plants for the Puget Sound Garden</h2>
                <h3>Lindsey Handley | May 7, 2025</h3>
            </div>

            <p>When I first started gardening, I assumed that a thriving, colorful yard meant constant watering and lots
                of fussing. But over the past few seasons, Iâ€™ve learned that some of the most beautiful and
                wildlife-friendly plants in the Pacific Northwest are also the ones that thrive on a little neglect. If
                youâ€™re hoping to create a garden that supports local ecosystems <em>and</em> doesnâ€™t need much water
                once established, youâ€™re in luck! There are some truly wonderful native plants that love our Puget Sound
                climate and ask for very little in return.</p>

            <p>Let me tell you about three of my favorite low-water natives: lupines, kinnikinnick, and columbines. Each
                one brings something special to the gardenâ€”and once theyâ€™ve had a season or so to settle in, they barely
                ask for a sip.</p>

            <p><strong>Lupines</strong> are showstoppers in the spring and early summer. Their tall flower spikes burst
                in purples, blues, and soft whites, and they absolutely <em>buzz</em> with bees. They do best with lots
                of sunshine and well-drained soilâ€”think gravelly or sandy, the kind you might worry is too dry for
                anything to grow. Lupines donâ€™t mind. Iâ€™ve had the best success starting them from seed, especially
                after soaking the seeds overnight or gently nicking them to help them sprout. After their first year,
                they rarely need additional water. I donâ€™t fertilize them, eitherâ€”theyâ€™re quite self-sufficient! Just
                snip off spent flower stalks to encourage more blooms and enjoy their natural charm.</p>

            <img src="../img/lilac.jpg" width="400px;" alt="lilac flowers">

            <p><strong>Kinnikinnick</strong> is one of the unsung heroes of the native plant world. This low, trailing
                evergreen is perfect for covering slopes or tucking between rocks. It stays green all year long and
                thrives in dry, sandy soil where other groundcovers might struggle. I planted a few small starts a
                couple years ago, and theyâ€™ve slowly crept out, forming a soft green mat. They donâ€™t need much in the
                way of pruning, though you can give them a light trim if you want to shape them. The first summer, I
                made sure to water them deeply once a weekâ€”but since then, theyâ€™ve been completely independent.</p>

            <p><strong>Columbine</strong> has a special place in my heart. The red and yellow blooms of our native
                western columbine are absolute hummingbird magnets. They do well in partial shade, but Iâ€™ve had some do
                just fine in sunnier spots tooâ€”as long as they had a little extra water early on. I like planting them
                in early spring, and I usually mulch around them to keep the soil moist that first year. Once theyâ€™ve
                settled in, theyâ€™re surprisingly hardy. And if you let them go to seed, theyâ€™ll often pop up in new
                places the following year, like little gifts from the garden.</p>

            <p>If you're looking to bring these lovely natives into your own space, you donâ€™t have to look far. The <a
                    href="https://www.wnps.org" target="_blank">Washington Native Plant Society</a> hosts seasonal plant
                sales across the state, including right here in Kitsap and the greater Seattle area. I always look
                forward to those! Thereâ€™s also the <a href="https://nativeplantsalvage.org" target="_blank">Native Plant
                    Salvage Foundation</a> down in Thurston County, and several great nurseries like <a
                    href="https://www.woodbrooknativeplantnursery.com/" target="_blank">Woodbrook Native Plant
                    Nursery</a> in Gig Harbor or <a href="https://plantsofthewild.com/" target="_blank">Plants of the
                    Wild</a>, which ships from eastern Washington. These places are full of gardeners who are just as
                excited as you are to help native plants find a new home.</p>

            <p>The key to success with drought-tolerant natives is to start them off right. Planting in fall or early
                spring gives the roots time to grow before our dry summers hit. For that first year, a deep watering
                once a week is usually enough. After that, theyâ€™re pretty much on their ownâ€”and thriving! A little mulch
                can help in the early days, but once theyâ€™re established, these plants are built to handle our dry
                spells.</p>

            <p>Iâ€™ve found so much joy in watching my garden fill out with plants that <em>belong</em> here. They bring
                in bees and birds, they hold up beautifully in summer, and they remind me that sometimes, less is more.
                If you try any of these plants in your own space, Iâ€™d love to hear how it goes!</p>
