        <p>
          Hi, I’m Lindsey, a nature-loving gardener from Kitsap County in the
          beautiful Pacific Northwest. I've been gardening for three years—still
          a beginner, but falling more in love with it every season. One of my
          favorite moments last year was watching hummingbirds flit around my
          gladiolus blooms—it was magical!

        <h2 id="h2-philosophy">My Gardening Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe that nature is sacred and that everyone can do their part to
          help restore and protect the native flora and fauna of the PNW. My
          garden is a small but intentional space where native plants can
          thrive, and pollinators and birds can find refuge. I never use
          pesticides—just patience, observation, and a deep respect for the
          natural world.

        <h2 id="h2-start">How It All Started</h2>
        <p>
          Believe it or not, my love of gardening was first sparked by a video
          game—Harvest Moon—in the 1990s. Years later, that spark turned into a
          real connection to my home and region through gardening. Creating this
          garden has helped me feel more rooted in the PNW than ever before.
